Extracting event information from email:

```python
restart_sequence = "}"
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="davinci",
  prompt="this is an incoming email:\n\"How about an after-work beer in Amstetten? Friday?\nSee you,\nJohn\"\nCalendar events are in the format {eventTitle: String,participants: Array<String>, location: String, when: String}\nThe calendar event extracted from the email:\n{",
  temperature=0,
  max_tokens=100,
  top_p=1,
  stop=["}"]
)
# Expected outcome:
